POST /api/login
{
  "email": "your@email.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

**Option B: API Key (Programmatic Access)**
Create an API key from the [Developer Settings](/api-reference/developer/api-keys) in your HomestayOS dashboard.

### Step 2: Make Your First Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://office.homestayos.com/api/properties \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

## API Overview

### Base URLs

- **Base URL**: `https://office.homestayos.com/api`

### Authentication

We support two authentication methods to fit your use case:

**Bearer Token Authentication**
Perfect for user-facing applications and web dashboards. Users log in and receive a token for their session.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

**API Key Authentication**
Ideal for server-to-server integrations, automation scripts, and background processes.

```bash
X-API-Key: {your_api_key}
```

<Note>
  Need an API key? Create one from the [Developer API Keys](/api-reference/developer/api-keys) endpoints or your HomestayOS dashboard.
</Note>

### Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

**Success Response**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "success": true
}
```

**Error Response**
```json
{
  "error": "Error type",
  "message": "Human-readable error message",
  "details": {}
}
```

### Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and system stability, API requests are rate-limited. Rate limit information is included in response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the limit resets

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use API Keys for Production**: For server-to-server integrations, use API keys instead of user tokens. They're more secure and don't expire with user sessions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Handle Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff when you hit rate limits. Check the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header to know when to retry.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Validate Input**: Always validate input on your side before sending requests. The API will return 422 errors for invalid data, but client-side validation improves UX.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Webhooks**: Instead of polling, set up webhooks to receive real-time updates. It's more efficient and reduces API calls.
</Tip>
